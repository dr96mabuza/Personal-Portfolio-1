# PERSONAL WEBSITE

## Description
I have created a personal portfolio webpage to exhibit  my accomplished projects, each demonstrating the skills I have acquired during my learning journey. The portfolio was constructed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Webpack for bundling. Without any external frameworks or libraries.
